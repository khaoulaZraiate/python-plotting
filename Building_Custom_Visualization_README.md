# python-plotting

Implement the bar coloring as described in the paper, where the color of the bar is actually based on the amount of data covered (e.g. a gradient ranging from dark blue for the distribution being certainly below this y-axis,
to white if the value is certainly contained, to dark red if the value is certainly not contained as the distribution is above the axis).
We Add interactivity to the above, which allows the user to click on the y axis to set the value of interest. The bar colors should change with respect to what value the user has selected.
