 The data for this project comes from a subset of The National Centers for Environmental Information (NCEI) Daily Global Historical Climatology Network (GHCN-Daily). The GHCN-Daily is comprised of daily climate records from thousands of land surface stations across the globe.

Each row in the assignment datafile corresponds to a single observation.

The following variables are provided to you:

id : station identification code
date : date in YYYY-MM-DD format (e.g. 2012-01-24 = January 24, 2012)
element : indicator of element type
TMAX : Maximum temperature (tenths of degrees C)
TMIN : Minimum temperature (tenths of degrees C)
value : data value for element (tenths of degrees C)

The data we have been given is near Ann Arbor, Michigan, United States, and the stations the data comes from are shown on the map below.
